# Hi, I'm Harriet üëã

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in PHP using the Symfony framework. I also have experience working with various frontend technologies including TypeScript/JavaScript, SCSS/CSS and I'm actively expanding my skill set by learning React to enhance my frontend development capabilities

### üë®‚Äçüíª Coding

In my coding journey, I've worked extensively with PHP and Symfony to build web applications. These technologies have been my go-to choice for developing web applications and leveraging the power of PHP's ecosystem. Recently, I've also been diving into [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/), which allows me to build powerful APIs with ease. Using API Platform, I have decoupled the NextJS/React frontend from the PHP Symfony backend of my applications.

Alongside PHP, Symfony, and API Platform, I have experience with various other languages and frameworks. Python has been another valuable tool in my repertoire, allowing me to create smaller, more versatile applications. I've also explored Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which proved useful for extending the functionality in Excel to the client's needs.

### ‚≠ê My favourite projects

- YouTube Downloader: I used to have slow internet so I made a YouTube downloader to download the latest videos from a number of set channels and add them to a local Plex server. Due to the amount of depencancies I'd like to redo the project at some point!

- Plex Discord Bot: Allows discord users to use their Plex server music in a voice channel.

- WordPress Timeline: A shortcode to create a timeline that uses bootstrap for the design and a custom post type for the timeline items.
