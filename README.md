# Hi, I'm Harriet üëã

I'm a passionate full-stack developer and a co-founder of Everbit Software. I have expertise in PHP using the Symfony framework and Svelte/Sveltekit using TypeScript. I also have experience working with various other frontend technologies including SCSS/CSS.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Coding

In my coding journey, I've worked extensively with Symfony, [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) and Svelte to build APIs and the web applications that go along with them. These technologies have been my go-to choice for developing web applications and leveraging the power of PHP's powerful backend technologies along with Svelte's ability to create incredible and interactive frontends.

Alongside PHP, Symfony, and API Platform, I have experience with various other languages and frameworks. Python has been another valuable tool in my repertoire, allowing me to create smaller, more versatile applications. I've also developed Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which proved useful for extending the functionality in Excel to the client's needs.

### ‚≠ê My favourite projects

- [Flex List](https://github.com/everbit-software/flex-list): A list library I made for easily working with dynamic data. I'm in the process of rewriting it to work with Svelte.

- Plex Discord Bot: Allows discord users to use their Plex server music in a voice channel.

- WordPress Timeline: A shortcode to create a timeline that uses bootstrap for the design and a custom post type for the timeline items.
